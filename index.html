<img src="movie 5.jpg" width="200" alt="Poster of Laapataa Ladies Moive."><hr>
<h3>Director: Nag Ashwin</h3>
<h4>Review:</h4>
<p>Kalki 2898 AD is a visually extravagant, uniquely Indian sci‑fi epic that tightens up toward an exciting climax, thanks largely to an inspired performance by Amitabh Bachchan. It succeeds in world-building and ambition—and in that sense reigns as a milestone for Tollywood sci‑fi. But its uneven pacing, weak character arcs, and derivative design hold it back from greatness.</p><hr/>
